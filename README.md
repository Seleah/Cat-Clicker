# Cat Clicker Premium Pro (Udacity)

## Purpose


This project is to practice using an organizational structure in JavaScript. The organizational structure used here goes by a few names, but I'll call it MVC. It involves splitting your code into three objects: the Model, the View and the Controller (I called it octopus).

## How to Run

## Test It!


Click on a name and see the picture. You can click on the picture as many times as you like to see the number of clicks displayed change. Then click on another name and do the same. You will notice that each cat has an accurate number of clicks, unique to each and that clicking on one cat will not change the number of clicks on another. 

Now click on the "Admin" button! Here you will see a form appear where you can change the displayed cat's name, the URL for the image and the number of clicks. Hitting "Save" will save your changes, clear the form and hide the form. If any of the fields in the form are left blank, there are no changes made to those properties of the displayed cat. Try out the "Cancel" button. It will clear the form without making any changes and hide the form.

Enjoy!
